Description: The goal of weaknull is to provide a frequentist statistical framework to test weak, nondirectional null hypotheses. Weak null hypotheses may be rejected in cases where individual subjects show reliable effects, even if these effects have opposite signs and cancel out at the group level in a standard t-test.
